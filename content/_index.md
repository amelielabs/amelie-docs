## Introduction

Amelie is a lightweight OLTP SQL relational database that focuses on performance and throughput for
short ACID transactions and real-time analytics. Its unique architecture is designed for full
parallelization and lockless transaction execution.

Amelie works over HTTP and does not require additional client libraries. Any modern programming
language or tooling that supports HTTP and JSON can be used directly.
