## Introduction

Amelie is lightweight OLTP SQL document database with a focus on performance and
throughput for short ACID transactions and real-time analytics. It has unique architecture designed
for full parallelization and lockless transaction execution.

Amelie works over HTTP and does not require additional client libraries. Any modern programming
language or tooling that supports HTTP and JSON can be used directly.
